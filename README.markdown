These notes are not a substitute for reading the book. They are a combination of memory aid, thinking out loud and todo list. I frequently leave out material I already know, don't find interesting or don't find evidence for. I don't attempt to reproduce most of the convincing arguments, detailed explanation or clarifying examples that make the books valuable. I may oversimplify, misread, mistype or misrepresent material.

Normal text paraphrases the author. __Bold text adds my own thoughts__.
